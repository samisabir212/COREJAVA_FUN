what is a list? number connected items or names written or printed consecutively
when you dont put diamond brackets in the linked.. it means you dont have any restirictions
list of 1 2 3 and list of 3 2 1 are different lists because of the order they are in.
duplicate values are allowed in linked lists or some other lists

arrays vs lists
    expensive to add element to an array
    the size of the array is fixed when created.
    if you create a huge array and dont use it up then its a waste of memory

    Linked List advantages
        one part contains data one part has a reference.
        Linked list uses node to store the data
            each node will have reference to its repective node
                you can go forward and backward

         has a node and address   node value 7 | address 980


    ARRAY LIST IMPLIMENTS THE LIST CLASS
    ArrayList
        arry list internally uses dynamic aray to store elements
            it grows automatically

    arraylist
        Manipulation with arraylist is slow because it internally uses array
        if any element is removed from the array, all the bits are shiftedin memory

    arraylist
        arraylist class can act as a list only because it implements list only

    arraylist
        is better for storing and accessing data

    LinkedList
        internally uses doubly linked list to store the elents

    LinkedList
        manipulation is faster than array lists
        because there is no bit shifting requried in memory

    LinkedList
        better for manipulating data






list behaviors
    add an element
    remove element
    find an element


methods in LinkedList
    add()
    add(E e)
    add(int index, E element)
        Inserts the specified element at the specified position in this list.
